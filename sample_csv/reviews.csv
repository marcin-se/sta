Found this hotel by reading over tripadvisor while planning a little beach getaway. Really good price by the beach. James the front desk manager was really fun, he made our stay more fun than we thought it would be. We are going to come back with our friends soon.
Across the road from Santa Monica Pier is exactly where you want to be when visiting Santa Monica, as well as not far from lots of shops and restaurants/bars. Hotel itself is very new & modern, rooms were great. Comfortable beds & possibly the best shower ever!
I have stayed here 4 or 5 times while visiting LA. Despite travelling all over the world and staying in some of the best international hotels ( for work), Hotel Caliornia is one of my absolute favourites. Perfect location, right on the beach. I love the way you can just open your door and be outside, no elevators, corridors big glass windows. The ambience is so nice, retro perfect. As for the staff, I have had consistently superb service, with much more personal service and attention to detail than is usual in bigger hotels. Aaron and Katy were just two who have been exemplary this time but really everyone is terrific. Can't recommend it highly enough.
Terrible. Old, not quite clean. Lost my reservation, then "found" a smaller room, for the same price, of course. Noisy. Absolutely no parking, unless you luck out for the $10 spaces (of which there are 12). Water in bathroom sink would not turn off. Not hair dryer, no iron in room. Miniscule shower- better be thin to use it!
I was excited to stay at this Hotel. It looked cute and was reasonable. It turned out to be terrible. We were woken up both mornings at 5:45 AM by noisy neighbors. The shower was clogged up...the room was sooooo small we kept tripping over each other. The saving grace was the pool at the Loews next door. I wish we had paid an extra $50 and stayed at a nicer place. This motel should cost no more than $99 a night.
This is the 3rd time I go and everytime I get treated like a queen. Great/clean room near the river. Impecable facilities, a nice quaint spot in the Laurentians where you start relaxing right away. With the overnight package having supper at CHEZ MILO make this a great getaway.
Really nice property along the river. Hot tubs are a bit out dated but were nice and cosy nestled along the riverside. Didn't visit the spa or steam room this time but on the previous visit in January I did and both were excellent.
Room is basic but is more than you expect for the price you pay. Hotel in general is always clean and tidy. The staff here are great, always friendly and helpful. The food here is average, fairly repetitive but there is always something new to choose from. The location is good, surrounded by bars and restaurants. There is also a port nearby which is ideal for day trips. We paid €25 each through the hotel for a day trip to Lindos, highly recommended. The only negative is that there is minimal bar staff, however George the barman is always very friendly and chatty to all of the guests.
Hotel is ok but not worth the money we paid.. Food is good , good selection, but it's cold which is a shame . We paid to upgrade , so we should have wifi I the room , coffee and tea making facilities, apparently no rooms have wifi and we have had 2 sachets of coffee in 3 days no milk you have to find the maid to get that , we haven't seen her yet . The room is nice. Obviously just been refurbed but it's tiny and the garden view is the roof of the restaurant. Staff are nice but you are restricted to two drinks, so if you want a water as well you have to go and put one drink down then go back . Still buying water from the shops and lugging back the one thing I didn't want to have to do on all inclusive. The drinks are not too bad
Pros:-great staff, well placed hotel,drinks & food good,rooms cleaned everyday except sundays. Cons:- the rooms are small & dated unless you get one of the newly renovated ones,pool area can get a bit over crowded & not enough sunbeds(have to get up really early to get one), nothing going on during the day to liven things up,entertainment at night poor & all inclusive drinks stop at 10.30
It was our first visit in this hotel and Rhodes and it was just wonderful. The best part of the hotel is definitely the staff. It is the nicest staff I have ever met! Also the localization is really good - it is 20 km to Rhodes and 20km to Lindos which are worth to visit. The bus ticket costs 3.90 eur. The restaurant and pool bar are also to be recommended.
Everything was as advertised. The service was friendly, the spa massages were good. The hardwood floors were a plus. The spring runoff made the river even more enticing. A very nice place to relax, not a tv in sight. The breakfast was a pleasant surprise, everything being home made.
We have been to the Beaux Reves a few times and couldn't beleive we didn't do this sooner. This is a quiet little Nordic SPA, nothing commercial about it. You can really be alone while you are there. The rushing sounds of the rapids are very soothing and you will sleep like a baby. The rooms are clean, comfortable and very inviting. The staff are invisible until you need them. There is no one shhhhshing you if you are talking quietly which is what I don't like about other Spa's. Great Breakfast too.
I just want to start by saying that for first time visitors I have no doubt you will enjoy yourself! Very nice location, quiet (even though it is on a highway), nice little town, not too far from Saint-Sauveur and decent prices! But, it is because you don’t know what you are missing!
We had a wonderful time. The room was huge and came with a gas fireplace and an in-room jacuzzi. We enjoyed pedicures and a massage by very caring, professional and qualified staff. The spring flow of the quaint river and its rapids provided us with non-stop and soothing sound whether we were in the hot tub overlooking the river or in our room. The spa facilities suited our desires and I loved the small and personal scale of the stone tower sauna, steam room and hot tubs. Hannes and his staff care for their guests and were very friendly. Hannes is perfectly bilingual and his staff always made us feel welcome whether we spoke in English or in our less than perfect French.
Just amazing... We had a lovely room (perfect for our mini-honeymoon!) with jacuzzi (and no TV- which was excellent because it forced us to relax and be in touch with ourselves and each other with no distractions). We had massages, which were great, and an algae treatment, as well as a black mud. The staff was nice, happy, and informative, and the owner was more than generous with his time (he gave us a tour), etc. The river was beautiful, and it was very quiet (even with the highway near by... The river drowns it out!).
this was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at the room they gave us first was nasty the sink and tub had used soap on them white stuff on the floor no toilet paper but the rolls were on the sink the ac was really loud and it didnot cool the room i could have screamed when i saw the room we were given
Worst stay ever!!!! The website lies about having a heated pool, the pool is cold and the manager said there are no heaters. The hotel is outdated and looks nothing like the pictures. I booked online, however had to pay more fees when I got to the hotel. There was no microwave in the room and the ice machine didnt even work. Dont waste your time or money!
Stay here at your peril. Really tired hotel that appears being run to the ground. Facilities awful. No tea/coffee in room. Room fridges look like they have something growing in them. The rooms are tatty and falling apart. Breakfast awful few boxes of cereal and few donuts and bagels. No butter whatsoever for the toast.
The hotel is very out of date and needs a lot of work. The paint needs work, the furniture is old and busted, the AC unit loud and cranky, the light fixtures are broken, the TV is still an old tube unit, the WIFI is extremely slow, the carpets are old and have an almost sticky feeling to them, all the bathroom fixtures are old and barely working.
we loved it cause its very relaxing and enjoyable... the staff very friendly and the rooms very nice and comfortable. the location is really good too!! everything is near by. we will be back again!!!!
Beautiful hotel and lovely staff. We have just come back everything was fab. Airconditioning was amazing as the temperature was 38 degrees. only downside is very quiet area but a bus ride gets you to somewhere more lively.. Would go again.
nice room, clean and large pool, GREAT FOOD (I mean great in all sense of the word), nice people with nice English, cousine full of fantasy prepared hardly (no chips or pizza...)animals around hotel :-)
